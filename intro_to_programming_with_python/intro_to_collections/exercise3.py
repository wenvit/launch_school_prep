# 3. Identify at least 2 differences between lists and tuples. 
# Identify at least 2 ways that lists and tuples are similar.

# Differences between lists and tuples
# 1. lists are mutable and tuples are not mutable
# 2. list literals are identified with brackets [] and 
# tuple literals are identified with parentheses ()
# 3. To make a single element tuple, must include trailing comma syntax
# this is not the case with single element list

# Similarities between lists and tuples
# 1. both lists and tuples are ordered sequences that can be indexed
# 2. both lists and tuples are heterogeneous, meaning they can contain
# a mix of object types
