# 8. To what value does the following expression evaluate?

# The following expression evaluations to True 
# The values being compared are strings.
# When python compares two 
# strings, it evaluates each character based on the 
# numeric values associated with the character in the 
# ASCII table
# so '1' evaluates to less than '9' as characters

print('12' < '9')
