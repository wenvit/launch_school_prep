# 7. What will the following code do? Why?

# The following code is attempting to explicitly 
# coerce the string value '3.1415' to an integer.
# However, it will produce an error because 3.1415 is not a 
# valid value that can be converted to an integer

#print(int('3.1415'))

# here's something that works...remove the decimal

print(int('34159'))
