# 2. Use the sqrt function from the math library to write 
# some code that outputs the square root of 37. 
# Try to write the code in three different ways.

### 1st way

# import math 

# print(math.sqrt(37))


### 2nd way

# import math as m

# print(m.sqrt(37))


### 3rd way

from math import sqrt

print(sqrt(37))
