# 4. This is a 3-part question. Consider the following dictionary:

pets = {
    'Cat':  'Meow',
    'Dog':  'Bark',
    'Bird': 'Tweet',
}

# Part 1: Write some code to print Bark by accessing the element 
# associated with the key Dog.
# Part 2: Write some code to print None when you try to print 
# the value associated with the non-existent key, Lizard.
# Part 3: Write some code to print <silence> when you try to 
# print the value associated with the non-existent key, Lizard.

print(pets['Dog'])
print(pets.get('Lizard'))
print(pets.get('Lizard', '<silence>'))
