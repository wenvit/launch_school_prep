This is a github repository created by Wendy Vit for 
the Launch School Prep Course 
**PY100 Programming & Back-end Prep with Python**

The intro_to_programming_with_python folder contains solutions for all exercises in each chapter of the *Introduction to Programming with Python* book. 

The python_basics_exercises contains solutions for all problems in  Python Basics Exercises.

This repo was originally multiple repos created beginning in Dec 2024. I reorganized the repos into a better, more streamlined structure for moving forward in Launch School.
