##### Problem statement

# Using the Python documentation, determine how you can write large integers 
# in a way that makes them easier to read.

##### Solution

# Can't find this in the documentation but 
# underscores can be used to make large integers easier to read

# From Launch School solution: search for integer literal, which is 
# discussed in the lexical analysis section
