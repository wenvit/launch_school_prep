##### Problem statement

# Predict the output of the following code:

if False or True:
    print('Yes!')
else:
    print('No...')

##### Solution

# This will print Yes!
# The if statement has an `or` operator, which evaluates
# to True if either operand is truthy
# In this case, since True is truthy, the first if block
# will execute
