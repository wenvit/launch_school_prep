##### Problem statement

# Predict the output of the following code:

if True and False:
    print('Yes!')
else:
    print('No...')

##### Solution

# This code will print No...
# An `and` condition evaluates to True if both
# operands are truthy. In this case, True is truthy but
# False is falsy, so the else block executes.
